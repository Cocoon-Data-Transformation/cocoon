At its core, it captures the streaming activity and audience engagement of different broadcasters on the platform. The **Channel** attribute identifies the unique name of each Twitch channel. The **Watch time(Minutes)** attribute indicates the total amount of time viewers have spent watching a channel, while **Stream time(minutes)** reflects the total duration the channel has been live and streaming content. The **Peak viewers** attribute shows the highest number of concurrent viewers a channel has had at any point, and **Average viewers** represents the average number of viewers watching the channel during streams.\n\nThe **Followers** attribute provides the total number of users who have followed the channel, suggesting the channel's popularity and reach. This is complemented by **Followers gained**, which tracks the increase in followers over a certain period. Similarly, **Views gained** measures the total number of video views accumulated by the channel, offering insight into overall content viewership.\n\nThe **Partnered** attribute indicates whether a channel has entered into a partnership with Twitch, which typically means access to additional features and revenue options. The **Mature** attribute denotes whether the channel's content is flagged as mature, affecting its potential audience. Lastly, the **Language** attribute specifies the primary language used in the channel's broadcasts, which can influence the channel's accessibility to different linguistic demographics."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Twitch Channel": {"Identity": {"Basic Info": ["Channel", "Language", "Partnered", "Mature"]}, "Content": {"Viewership": ["Watch time(Minutes)", "Stream time(minutes)", "Peak viewers", "Average viewers"]}, "Growth": {"Followers": ["Followers", "Followers gained"], "Engagement": ["Views gained"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "Followers"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "Average viewers"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "Peak viewers"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "Partnered"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "Mature"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "Language"}]}, "missing_value": {"Channel": {}, "Watch time(Minutes)": {}, "Stream time(minutes)": {}, "Peak viewers": {}, "Average viewers": {}, "Followers": {}, "Followers gained": {}, "Views gained": {}, "Partnered": {}, "Mature": {}, "Language": {}}, "unusual": {"Channel": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Watch time(Minutes)": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Stream time(minutes)": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Peak viewers": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Average viewers": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Followers": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Followers gained": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Views gained": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Partnered": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Mature": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "Language": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Watch Time to Stream Time Ratio", "reasoning": "Watch time should be greater than or equal to stream time since watch time accumulates over the stream time", "sql": "SELECT * FROM twitchdata_update WHERE `Watch time(Minutes)` < `Stream time(minutes)`"}, {"name": "Peak Viewers to Average Viewers Check", "reasoning": "Peak viewers should be greater than or equal to average viewers", "sql": "SELECT * FROM twitchdata_update WHERE `Peak viewers` < `Average viewers`"}, {"name": "Followers Gained to Followers Check", "reasoning": "Followers gained should be less than or equal to total followers", "sql": "SELECT * FROM twitchdata_update WHERE `Followers gained` > `Followers`"}, {"name": "Views Gained to Followers Check", "reasoning": "It's unlikely but possible that views gained could be less than followers.
