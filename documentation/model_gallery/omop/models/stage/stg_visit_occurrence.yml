    cocoon_meta:
      uniqueness: This column represents the date and time the visit started, providing
        a more precise timestamp than visit_start_date. For this table, each row represents
        a unique healthcare visit. Given the granularity of datetime (including hours,
        minutes, and potentially seconds), it's much more likely to be unique for
        each visit. While there's a small possibility of two visits starting at the
        exact same second, in practice, this column could serve as a candidate key,
        especially if the system ensures unique timestamps for each visit.
