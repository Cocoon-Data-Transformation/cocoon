- name: stg_specimen
  description: The table is about biological specimens. It contains details of sample
    collection. Each specimen has an ID, associated person ID, collection date and
    time. The table includes quantity, source, unit, anatomical site, and health status.
    This data allows tracking and analysis of biological samples from different individuals.
  columns:
  - name: specimen_id
    description: Unique identifier for each biological specimen
    tests:
    - not_null
    - unique
    cocoon_meta:
      unique_reason: This column represents a unique identifier for each biological
        specimen. For this table, each row is for a distinct specimen, and specimen_id
        is unique across rows.
  - name: person_id
    description: Identifier for the person providing the specimen
    tests:
    - not_null
  - name: specimen_date
    description: Date when the specimen was collected
    tests:
    - not_null
  - name: specimen_datetime
    description: Date and time when the specimen was collected
    tests:
    - not_null
    - unique
    cocoon_meta:
      unique_reason: This column represents the date and time when the specimen was
        collected. For this table, each row is for a distinct specimen, and it's highly
        unlikely (but not impossible) for two specimens to be collected at the exact
        same second. However, it could potentially be unique across rows.
  - name: quantity
    description: Amount of specimen collected
    tests:

  - name: specimen_source_value
    description: Type or origin of the biological specimen

  - name: unit_source_value
    description: Unit of measurement for the specimen quantity
