    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- complaint_category: The complaint_category column has several issues: 1. 'Closing/Cancelling account' overlaps with 'Account opening, closing, or management'. 2. 'Other' and 'Other fee' are vague categories that don't provide specific information. 3. Some categories are very specific (e.g., 'Balance transfer fee') while others are broad (e.g., 'Billing disputes'). 4. There's inconsistency in naming conventions (e.g., 'APR or interest rate' vs 'Balance transfer fee'). To address these issues, we'll map overlapping categories together, replace vague categories with more specific ones where possible, and standardize naming conventions.
