    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- market_classification: The problem is that both values in the market_classification column are incomplete sentences that do not represent clear market classifications. They appear to be truncated or nonsensical phrases rather than meaningful categories. The correct values for market classifications should be clear, concise categories describing the market segment or type of product/service. Since we don't have enough context to determine what the intended classifications were, the best approach is to map these unusual values to an empty string. 
    -- market_description: The problem is that both values in the market_description column are incoherent sentences that do not describe markets in any meaningful way. They appear to be randomly generated text or gibberish. The correct values should be empty strings since the existing text provides no useful market description information. 
    -- company_name: The problem is that both 'cally' and 'ese' appear to be incomplete or truncated company names. Without more context or information about the full company names, it's difficult to determine the correct complete names. These values are likely the result of data truncation or improper data entry. The correct values should be the full company names, but we don't have enough information to determine what those are. 
    -- street_type: The problem is inconsistent abbreviation and punctuation styles in the street_type column. 'Cir.' uses a period at the end, while 'Ln' does not. The correct values should use a consistent style, preferably without periods for brevity and consistency with common addressing standards.
