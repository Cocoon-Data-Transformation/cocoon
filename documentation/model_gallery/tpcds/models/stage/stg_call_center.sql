    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- operating_hours: The problem is that '8AM-8AM' is an unusual representation for 24-hour operation. It's inconsistent with the more common format seen in '8AM-4PM'. The correct values should represent the actual operating hours clearly. For 24-hour operation, it's more standard to use '24 hours' or '12AM-11:59PM'. 
    -- market_class: The problem is that both values in the market_class column are incomplete phrases that do not represent clear market classifications. They appear to be truncated or partial sentences without any meaningful market categorization. The correct values for a market_class column should be concise, clear categories describing the market segment or classification. Since the existing values are meaningless in this context, they should be mapped to an empty string. 
    -- market_description: The problem is that both values in the market_description column are incomplete sentences with abrupt endings and lack clear meaning. They appear to be truncated or corrupted text that does not provide any useful information about market description. The correct approach is to map these meaningless values to empty strings.
