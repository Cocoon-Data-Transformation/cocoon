  description: The table is about daylight saving time data. It contains information
    for different time zones and years. The details include the start and end times
    of daylight saving in UTC, and the daylight offset. Each row represents a specific
    time zone and year combination with its corresponding daylight saving information.
  columns:

      uniqueness: This column represents the end date and time of daylight saving
        in UTC. For this table, each row is for a specific time zone and year combination.
        The daylight_saving_end_utc could potentially be unique across rows, as it's
        unlikely for different time zones to have the exact same end time down to
        the second.
  - name: daylight_saving_start_utc
    description: Start date and time of daylight saving in UTC
    tests:
    - not_null
    - unique
    cocoon_meta:
      uniqueness: This column represents the start date and time of daylight saving
        in UTC. For this table, each row is for a specific time zone and year combination.
        The daylight_saving_start_utc could potentially be unique across rows, as
        it's unlikely for different time zones to have the exact same start time down
        to the second.
