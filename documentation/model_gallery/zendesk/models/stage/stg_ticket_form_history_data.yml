      uniqueness: This column represents the timestamp when the ticket form was last
        updated. For this table, each row represents a version or update of a ticket
        form. The updated_at column is unique across rows, as it captures the exact
        moment of each update, which is unlikely to be exactly the same for different
        updates.
