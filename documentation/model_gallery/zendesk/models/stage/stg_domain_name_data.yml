  description: The table represents a relation between organizations and domain names.
    Each row links an organization ID to a domain name. Some organizations may have
    multiple domain names associated with them, as seen with organization 370298 which
    has two entries. The domain names appear to be hashed or encrypted values rather
    than readable URLs.
  columns:
  - name: row_index

    cocoon_meta:
      uniqueness: This column represents a hashed or encrypted domain name associated
        with an organization. For this table, each row represents a link between an
        organization and a domain name. The encrypted_domain appears to be unique
        across rows in the given sample, and it's reasonable to assume that each domain
        name would have a unique encrypted value.
