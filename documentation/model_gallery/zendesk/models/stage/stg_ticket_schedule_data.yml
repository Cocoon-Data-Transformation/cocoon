  description: 'The table represents a relation between tickets and schedules. It
    contains three main pieces of information: the creation timestamp, the ticket
    ID, and the schedule ID. Each row links a specific ticket to a particular schedule,
    indicating when the ticket was created and associated with that schedule. The
    consistent schedule ID (3600) suggests all tickets in the sample are linked to
    the same schedule.'

    cocoon_meta:
      uniqueness: This column represents the timestamp when a ticket was created.
        For this table, each row represents a unique ticket associated with a schedule.
        The created_at timestamp is likely to be unique across rows, as it's unlikely
        that two tickets would be created at the exact same second. However, in theory,
        it's possible for two tickets to have the same creation timestamp if they
        were created simultaneously or if the system doesn't have millisecond precision.
