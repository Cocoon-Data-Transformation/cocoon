- name: NYC_RentalIndex_ByNeighborhood_2018_09
  description: The table contains rental index data for various NYC neighborhoods.
    Each index uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the same 
    properties since January 1995 in Manhattan and January 2005 in Brooklyn and Queens. 
    The data shows rental prices, month-over-month changes, and year-over-year changes. 
    Each partition represents a specific area like Downtown, Midtown, or Brooklyn 
    neighborhoods.
