  description: The table shows price indices and rent indices for Brooklyn. Each index uses 
    a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the same properties since 
    January 1995 in Manhattan and January 2005 in Brooklyn and Queens. It covers condos,
    co-ops, and homes. Data is split into quintiles. Monthly and yearly changes are
    included. The table starts from 1995 but has missing early data. It likely continues
    to 2018.
