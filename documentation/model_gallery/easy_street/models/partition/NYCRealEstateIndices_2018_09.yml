  description: The table shows price and rent indices for NYC condos, co-ops, and
    homes. Each index uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the 
    same properties. It includes monthly data starting from 1995. The price index partition
    has columns for date, overall NYC index, month-over-month change, and year-over-year
    change. The rent index likely has a similar structure. Both partitions focus on
    September 2018 data.
