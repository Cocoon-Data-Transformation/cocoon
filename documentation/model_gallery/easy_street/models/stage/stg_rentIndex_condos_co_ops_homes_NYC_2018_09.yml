  description: The table shows price and rent indices for NYC condos, co-ops, and
    homes. Each index uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of
    the same properties. It includes monthly data starting from 1995. The price index
    partition has columns for date, overall NYC index, month-over-month change, and
    year-over-year change. The rent index likely has a similar structure. Both partitions
    focus on September 2018 data.

      unique_reason: This column represents the date of the recorded data. For this
        table, each row corresponds to a specific month's data for NYC housing prices.
        Since the data is monthly starting from 1995, the date_ column will have a
        unique value for each row, making it distinct across all records.
