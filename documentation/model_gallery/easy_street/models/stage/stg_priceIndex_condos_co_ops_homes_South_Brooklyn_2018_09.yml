      unique_reason: This column represents the date of the housing price data. For
        this table, each row represents price indices for housing in NYC boroughs
        for a specific date. Since the data spans from 1995 to at least 2018 and is
        likely recorded monthly or daily, the date_ column should be unique across
        rows.
