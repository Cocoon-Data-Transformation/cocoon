  description: The table shows price and rent indices for NYC condos, co-ops, and
    homes. Each index uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of
    the same properties. It includes monthly data starting from 1995. The price index
    partition has columns for date, overall NYC index, month-over-month change, and
    year-over-year change. The rent index likely has a similar structure. Both partitions
    focus on September 2018 data.

      unique_reason: This column represents the date of the recorded data. For this
        table, each row represents price index data for a specific date. Since the
        data is monthly starting from 1995, the date_ column should be unique across
        rows, with one entry per month.
