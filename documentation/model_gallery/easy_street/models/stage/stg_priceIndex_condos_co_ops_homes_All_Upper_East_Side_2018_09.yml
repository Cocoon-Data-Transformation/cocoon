  description: The table shows price indices for housing in NYC boroughs. Each index
    uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the same properties.
    It includes data for Downtown, Midtown, Upper East Side, and other neighborhoods.
    Each partition has columns for date, sales price, month-over-month change, and
    year-over-year change. The data spans from 1995 to at least 2018. It tracks housing
    market trends across various NYC areas.

        this table, each row represents housing price data for a specific date. Since
        the data is presented monthly, the date_ column is unique across rows, as
        there should be only one entry per month.
