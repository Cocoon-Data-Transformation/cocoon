  description: The table contains rental index data for various NYC neighborhoods.
    Each index uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the same
    properties since January 1995 in Manhattan and January 2005 in Brooklyn and Queens.
    The data shows rental prices, month-over-month changes, and year-over-year changes.
    Each partition represents a specific area like Downtown, Midtown, or Brooklyn
    neighborhoods.
