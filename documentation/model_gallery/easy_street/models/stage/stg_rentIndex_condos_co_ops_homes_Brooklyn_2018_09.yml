  description: The table shows price indices and rent indices for Brooklyn. Each index
    uses a repeat-sales method of comparing the sales prices of the same properties
    since January 1995 in Manhattan and January 2005 in Brooklyn and Queens. It covers
    condos, co-ops, and homes. Data is split into quintiles. Monthly and yearly changes
    are included. The table starts from 1995 but has missing early data. It likely
    continues to 2018.
