  description: The table is about campaign-level report data. It contains daily performance
    metrics for advertising campaigns. Each row represents a campaign's performance
    on a specific date. Details include campaign ID, date, budget rules, bidding strategy,
    budget amount, currency, budget type, clicks, cost, and impressions. The data
    appears to be for low-performing or newly launched campaigns, as most metrics
