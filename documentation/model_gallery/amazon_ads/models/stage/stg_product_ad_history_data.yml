- name: stg_product_ad_history_data
  description: The table is about product ad history. It tracks changes in ad status
    over time for specific products. Each row represents a state change for an ad,
    identified by a unique ID. The table includes details like ad group ID, ASIN,
    campaign ID, creation date, serving status, and state. The 'last_updated_date'
    column shows when each change occurred, allowing for a chronological view of ad
    status changes.

      unique_reason: This column represents the timestamp of the most recent update
        to the ad. For this table, each row represents a state change for an ad at
        a specific point in time. The last_updated_date is unique across rows as it
        captures the exact moment of each state change, which is unlikely to be exactly
        the same for different updates.
