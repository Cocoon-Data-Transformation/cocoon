  description: The table is about advertised product reports. It includes data on
    ad groups, ads, and campaigns. Each row represents daily performance metrics for
    a specific ad. Key details include campaign budget information, clicks, cost,
    and impressions. The table also has fields for advertised ASIN and SKU, though
