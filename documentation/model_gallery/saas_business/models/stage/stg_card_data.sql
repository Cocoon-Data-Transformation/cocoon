    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- card_brand: The problem is that the card_brand column contains a value that appears to be a hash or encrypted string ('553f65f270c86a4a05c964dc20e8cc70') instead of an actual card brand name. This is unusual because card brands are typically recognizable names like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc. The hash-like value doesn't provide any meaningful information about the card brand. Since we don't have enough information to determine the actual card brand, and the current value is not useful, the most appropriate action is to map this unusual value to an empty string. 
    -- metadata: The problem is that there are empty JSON objects ('{}') in the metadata column, which are inconsistent with the other entries. The correct values should all follow the pattern of having an "external_id" key with a string value. The empty JSON objects are likely placeholder entries or errors that should be corrected.
