    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- ad_group_name: The problem is that the ad_group_name column contains a single unusual value that combines a date-time stamp with 'Ad group'. This is not a typical format for an ad group name, which usually consists of a descriptive name related to the ad campaign or target audience. The correct value should be a meaningful ad group name without the date-time prefix. 
    -- keyword_category: The problem is inconsistency in representing cat-related interests. We have 'cat lover', 'cat drawing', and 'cat', which are all related to cats but represented differently. The correct approach would be to standardize these under a single category. Since 'cat lover' is the most frequent among these, we'll use it as the standard representation.
