    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- owner_username: The problem is that 'username' is a generic placeholder value and not a real username. In a real dataset, this column should contain actual usernames of the owners. Since we don't have any real usernames to map to, and a generic placeholder is not meaningful data, we should map this to an empty string. 
    -- account_permissions: The problem is that 'string' is being used as a placeholder value for the account_permissions column, which is not a meaningful representation of actual account permissions. This suggests that either the real permission data is missing or was not properly populated. In a real-world scenario, account permissions would typically be specific descriptors like 'read', 'write', 'admin', or combinations of these. Without knowing the intended permission structure for this system, we can't map 'string' to a correct value. The best approach is to map it to an empty string to indicate missing data.
