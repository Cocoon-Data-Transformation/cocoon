    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- fiscal_period: The problem is that the fiscal_period column contains an encoded value 'JxJ3Au0JjyhOOUE/UvIeOw==' which is not a standard fiscal period format. This appears to be a Base64 encoded string, possibly used for data obfuscation or compression. Without knowing the decoding method or the original intended value, it's impossible to determine the correct fiscal period. The correct values for fiscal periods are typically in formats like 'Q1 2023', 'FY2023', or specific date ranges. 
    -- opportunity_name: The problem is that 'Blue Test -' has a trailing dash which should be removed.  'lu test 1', 'lu test 2', 'lu test 3' are redundant entries that should be consolidated.  The other values seem to be legitimate opportunity names and don't require changes.  The correct values should remove the trailing dash from 'Blue Test -' and consolidate the 'lu test' entries into a single value.
