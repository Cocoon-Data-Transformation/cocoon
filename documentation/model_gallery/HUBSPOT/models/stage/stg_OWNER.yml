  description: The table is about owners or users. It contains personal details like
    name and email. Each owner has a unique ID. The table tracks when the record was
    created and last updated. It also indicates if the user is active. The ACTIVE_USER_ID
    may link to another table. The IS_ACTIVE field shows the current status of the
    owner. The _FIVETRAN_SYNCED field likely relates to data synchronization timing.
