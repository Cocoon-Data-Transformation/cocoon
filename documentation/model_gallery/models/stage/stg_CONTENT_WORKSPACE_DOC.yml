  description: The table represents the relationship between content workspaces and
    content documents. It tracks which documents belong to which workspaces. The table
    includes creation dates, ownership status, and deletion flags. It also has fields
    for syncing and tracking changes (_FIVETRAN_DELETED, _FIVETRAN_SYNCED). This table
    likely supports a content management system where documents are organized into
    workspaces.
