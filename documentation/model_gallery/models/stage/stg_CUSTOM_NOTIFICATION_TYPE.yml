  description: The table is about custom notification types in a system. It includes
    details like ID, name, language, label, and creation information. The table tracks
    whether notifications are for desktop, mobile, or Slack. It also stores metadata
    like creation date, last modified date, and system timestamp. The table allows
    for soft deletion and namespace prefixing, likely for multi-tenant systems or
    package management.
