  description: The table represents a relation between custom permissions. It tracks
    dependencies where one custom permission requires another. Each record links a
    custom permission to its required permission. The table includes metadata like
    creation and modification dates, user IDs for tracking changes, and a deletion
    flag. It likely supports a permission system where certain permissions have prerequisites.
