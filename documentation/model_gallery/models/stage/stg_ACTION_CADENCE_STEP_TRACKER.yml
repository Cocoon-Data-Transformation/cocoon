  description: The table tracks steps within action cadences. It relates action cadence
    trackers, steps, and targets. Each row represents a step's status for a specific
    target within a cadence. It includes details like state, completion date, step
    type, and due date. The table also tracks who created or modified the record and
    when. It appears to be part of a larger system for managing and tracking structured
    action sequences.
