  description: The table is about user or external user accounts. It contains basic
    user information like name, email, and external IDs. The table tracks creation
    and modification dates, as well as who created or modified the record. It includes
    flags for deletion status and synchronization with an external system (likely
    Fivetran). The table appears to be used for provisioning or managing user accounts,
    possibly in a system that integrates with external user data sources.
