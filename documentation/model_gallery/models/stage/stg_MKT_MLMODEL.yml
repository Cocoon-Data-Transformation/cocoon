  description: The table is about machine learning models. It includes model details
    like ID, name, description, and API name. It tracks model ownership, creation,
    and modification dates. The table also stores model status information such as
    deployment status, last run status, and sync status. It captures performance metrics
    like last refresh date and processed records. The scoring mode and aggregated
    status are also included.
