  description: The table is about filter criteria for data spaces. It contains unique
    identifiers, deletion status, developer names, language, labels, and creation/modification
    timestamps. The table also includes parent IDs and child types, suggesting hierarchical
    relationships. It has an operator field, likely for defining filter conditions.
    The table tracks system modifications and includes Fivetran-specific fields for
    syncing and deletion tracking.
