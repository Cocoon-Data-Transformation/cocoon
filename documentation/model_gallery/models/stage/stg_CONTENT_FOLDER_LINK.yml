  description: The table 'CONTENT_FOLDER_LINK' represents a relationship between content
    folders and their parent entities. It links parent entities to content folders,
    possibly in a hierarchical structure. The table includes fields for identifying
    the relationship (ID), the parent entity (PARENT_ENTITY_ID), and the content folder
    (CONTENT_FOLDER_ID). It also tracks deletion status (IS_DELETED) and folder status
    (ENABLE_FOLDER_STATUS). The _FIVETRAN fields suggest data synchronization tracking.
