  description: The table is about digital content items. It contains identifiers like
    ID, SSOT_ID_C, and KQ_ID_C. The table includes the content name (SSOT_NAME_C)
    and source information (SSOT_DATA_SOURCE_ID_C, SSOT_DATA_SOURCE_OBJECT_ID_C).
    It also has metadata columns for tracking deletions (_FIVETRAN_DELETED) and synchronization
    (_FIVETRAN_SYNCED). This table likely serves as a central repository for digital
    content metadata across different systems.
