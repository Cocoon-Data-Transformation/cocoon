- name: stg_PERMISSION_SET_TAB_SETTING
  description: The table is about permission set tab settings. It contains details
    such as ID, parent ID, visibility, name, system modification timestamp, deletion
    status, and sync timestamp. Each row represents a specific tab setting with its
    visibility (e.g., DefaultOn) and associated standard object (e.g., PartyConsent,
    EdgeMart). The table likely relates to configuring tab visibility within permission
    sets in a Salesforce-like system.
