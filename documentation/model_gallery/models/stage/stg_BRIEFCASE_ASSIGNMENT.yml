  description: The table represents the assignment of briefcases to users or groups.
    It tracks the creation and modification details of each assignment. The table
    includes IDs for the user/group and the briefcase. It also has system fields for
    tracking changes and deletions. The table likely supports a feature where briefcases
    (possibly containing documents or cases) are allocated to specific users or groups
    in a system.
