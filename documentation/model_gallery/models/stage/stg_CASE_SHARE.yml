  description: The table represents the sharing relationships for cases. It links
    cases (CASE_ID) with users or groups (USER_OR_GROUP_ID) who have access. The CASE_ACCESS_LEVEL
    indicates the level of access granted. ROW_CAUSE explains why the sharing was
    created. The table also tracks modification details and deletion status. It appears
    to be part of a CRM or case management system with granular access control.
