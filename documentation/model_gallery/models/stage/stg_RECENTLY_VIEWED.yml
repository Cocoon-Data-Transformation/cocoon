  description: The table is about recently viewed items in a CRM system. It contains
    details such as ID, name, type, last viewed date, and other attributes of various
    objects like accounts, contacts, and list views. The table tracks when items were
    last viewed or referenced. It includes flags for active status and deletion. The
    data appears to be synced from another system, possibly Salesforce, given the
    field names and structure.
