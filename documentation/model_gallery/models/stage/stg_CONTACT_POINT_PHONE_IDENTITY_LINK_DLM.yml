  description: The table is a relation between contact points, phone identities, and
    data sources. It links source records (likely contacts) to unified records. It
    includes identifiers for the data source and object type. The table tracks creation
    dates and sync status. It seems to be part of a data integration or master data
    management system, connecting different representations of contact information
    across systems.
