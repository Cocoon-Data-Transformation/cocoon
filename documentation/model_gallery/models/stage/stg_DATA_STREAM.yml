  description: The table is about data streams in a system. It contains details like
    stream ID, owner, name, status, creation date, and last modification date. Each
    row represents a unique data stream with attributes such as import run status,
    refresh frequency, and stream type. The table also tracks metrics like total rows
    processed and last refresh date. It includes fields for external identifiers and
    error codes, suggesting integration with external systems.
