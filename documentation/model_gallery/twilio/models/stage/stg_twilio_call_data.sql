    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- record_created_at: The problem is that the date '2022-02-30' is invalid because February never has 30 days. The correct value should be the last day of February in 2022, which is February 28th. All other dates in the list appear to be valid and do not need correction. 
    -- call_end_time: The problem is that '2022-02-30 17:23:13.000000 UTC' contains an invalid date. February 30th does not exist in any year. The most likely explanation is that this is a data entry error, and the intended date was February 28th (the last day of February in non-leap years) or March 2nd (if it was meant to be the last day of February plus 2 days). Since 2022 was not a leap year, the most probable correct date is February 28th. 
    -- call_start_time: The problem is that '2022-02-30 17:23:13.000000 UTC' is an invalid date because February never has 30 days. All other dates in the list appear to be valid. The correct value for this date should be the last day of February in 2022, which is February 28th. 
    -- record_updated_at: The problem is that '2022-02-30 17:23:13.000000 UTC' is an invalid date because February 30th doesn't exist in any calendar year. February can have at most 29 days in a leap year. The correct value should be the last valid day of February 2022, which is February 28th, 2022. All other dates in the list appear to be valid and don't need correction.
