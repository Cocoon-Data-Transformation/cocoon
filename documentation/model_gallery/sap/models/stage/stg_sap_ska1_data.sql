    -- Clean unusual string values: 
    -- chart_of_accounts: The problem is that 'dabe' is the only value present in the chart_of_accounts column, and it's not a recognized accounting term. It's likely a typo for 'debit', which is a common term in accounting. The correct value should be 'debit'. 
    -- is_balance_sheet_account: The problem is that 'x' is not a clear indicator of balance sheet account status. Typically, a boolean column like this would use values such as 'true'/'false', 'yes'/'no', or 1/0 to indicate whether an account is a balance sheet account or not. The single value 'x' is ambiguous and doesn't provide a clear opposite for non-balance sheet accounts. The correct values should be more explicit boolean indicators.
