      uniqueness: This column represents a unique identifier for each spam report.
        For this table, each row corresponds to a single spam report event. The event_id
        appears to be a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), which is designed to
        be unique across all instances. Therefore, event_id is unique across rows.
