      uniqueness: This column represents a unique identifier for each deferred email
        event. For this table, each row represents a distinct deferred email event.
        The event_id appears to be a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), which is
        designed to be unique across all instances. Therefore, event_id is unique
        across rows.
