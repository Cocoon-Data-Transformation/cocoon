  description: The table is about geographical regions. It contains details of different
    world regions. Each region has a unique key, a name, and a comment. The regions
    included are Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Middle East. The comments seem
    to be randomly generated text without specific meaning related to the regions.
  columns:
  - name: region_id
    description: Unique identifier for each region

    - not_null
    - unique
    cocoon_meta:
      unique_reason: This column represents a unique identifier for each region. For
        this table, each row represents a distinct geographical region. The region_id
        appears to be unique across rows, as it's a standard practice to use unique
        identifiers for such data.

    cocoon_meta:
      unique_reason: This column contains the name of each geographical region. For
        this table, each row represents a distinct region, and the names provided
        (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Middle East) are unique. However, in a larger
        dataset, there could potentially be regions with the same name (e.g., North
        America and South America both containing "America"), so it's not guaranteed
        to be unique.
