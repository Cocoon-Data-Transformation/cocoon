  description: The table is about survey embedded data. It contains information related
    to survey responses. The table has columns for import_id, key_, response_id, and
    value_. The import_id and key_ seem to represent categories like "Website" and

        For this table, each row appears to be a single piece of embedded data for
        a survey response. The response_id is likely to be unique across rows for
        each unique survey response, even though it may appear multiple times for
        different data categories of the same response.
