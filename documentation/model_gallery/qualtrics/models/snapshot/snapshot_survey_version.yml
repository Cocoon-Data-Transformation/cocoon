  description: The table is about the latest versions of surveys. It tracks the most
    recent state of each survey, including its ID, deletion status, description, publication
    status, associated user, and creation date. The table indicates whether a survey
    was ever published and provides a unique identifier for each survey's latest version.
    It excludes version-specific information, focusing on the current state of each
    survey.
