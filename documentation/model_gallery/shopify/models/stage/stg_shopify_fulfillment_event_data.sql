    -- shipping_city: The problem is inconsistency in city naming conventions and potentially incorrect data. 'LA' is an abbreviation for 'Los Angeles' and should be written in full to match the format of other cities. 'LAZYTOWN' appears to be a fictional place and is likely an error or placeholder. The correct values should be full city names, consistent with the format used for 'LONDON' and 'ECHO PARK'. 
    -- shipping_zip_code: The problem is that the zip code '2759' is missing a leading zero, which is required for standard 5-digit US zip codes. 'CR0' is not a valid US zip code format at all, suggesting it might be an international postal code or an error. The correct values for US zip codes should be 5-digit numbers, starting with a leading zero for codes less than 10000.
