The **Total_recovered** shows the number of individuals who have recovered from the virus, suggesting the extent of resolved cases within the population. The **Active_cases** attribute represents the current number of infected individuals who are still battling the disease. The **Critical_cases** attribute provides insight into the number of severe cases that require intensive medical care. The **Total_tests** attribute gives the total number of COVID-19 tests conducted, which can be indicative of the country's testing capacity and response.
