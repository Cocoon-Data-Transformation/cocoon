Area House Age** attribute indicates the average age of houses in the vicinity, giving an idea of the housing stock's newness or antiquity. The **Avg. Area Number of Rooms** and **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms** provide insights into the size and capacity of the average house in the area, with the former detailing the total number of rooms and the latter specifying the number of bedrooms. The **Area Population** attribute relates to the number of people living in the area, which can influence demand for housing. The **House Price** is a critical attribute that denotes the price of the house in question. Lastly, the **Address** provides the specific location of each house, which can be a significant factor in the valuation and appeal of the property.
