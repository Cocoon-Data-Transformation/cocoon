model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__block,"This SQL query performs a series of transformations on data from a Qualtrics block table. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary staging table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types. Finally, it renames and reorganizes these fields, including changing some column names for clarity (e.g., 'block_locking' to 'is_locked', 'id' to 'block_id'). The query doesn't filter, deduplicate, or aggregate data, but it does standardize the data types and structure of the output.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__directory_contact,"This SQL query stages data from a temporary Qualtrics directory contact table. It performs type casting, standardizes email and phone formats, and renames some columns. The query also adds a source relation column and structures the final output.","[""Cleaning"",""Featurization""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__directory,"This SQL query performs a series of transformations on data from a Qualtrics directory source. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary staging table, then casts specific columns to appropriate data types, and finally renames and reorganizes the columns. The query also includes some boolean flags for deduplication criteria, though these are initially set to NULL. The purpose seems to be to standardize and prepare the Qualtrics directory data for further use or analysis.","[""Cleaning"",""Featurization""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__user,"This SQL query performs data cleaning and transformation on the 'stg_qualtrics__user' table. It starts by casting all fields to specific data types, then renames some columns, and adjusts data types for timestamp fields. The query also renames some boolean fields for clarity (e.g., 'unsubscribed' to 'is_unsubscribed'). Finally, it selects all transformed fields into a final output.","[""Cleaning"",""Featurization""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__survey_embedded_data,"This SQL query creates a staging table for Qualtrics survey embedded data. It starts with a base CTE that selects all columns from a temporary table. Then, it defines a fields CTE that casts specific columns to appropriate data types, including setting default values. Finally, it selects and reorders these fields in the final CTE.

The query also includes a placeholder for a source relation column.","[""Cleaning"",""Featurization""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__distribution_contact,"This SQL query performs a basic staging operation on the Qualtrics distribution contact data. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types (mostly casting to NULL or empty string). Finally, it selects these fields, casting some timestamp fields explicitly, and creates the final output. The query doesn't perform any complex transformations, filtering, or aggregations; it's primarily focused on structuring the data with defined data types.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__question_option,"This SQL query is primarily focused on data cleaning and restructuring. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary staging table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types and default values.

The query doesn't perform any filtering, deduplication, featurization, integration, or aggregation.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__sub_question,"This SQL query performs a basic transformation on data from a staging table. It casts several columns to specific data types, renames the '_fivetran_deleted' column to 'is_deleted', and selects a subset of columns for the final output. The query doesn't perform any filtering, deduplication, featurization, integration, or aggregation.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.qualtrics_source.stg_qualtrics__question_response,"This SQL query creates a staging table for Qualtrics question responses.
