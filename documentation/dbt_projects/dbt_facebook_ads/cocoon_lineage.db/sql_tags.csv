model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__ad_set_report,"This SQL query integrates data from multiple Facebook Ads related tables (basic ad reports, account history, campaign history, ad set history, and ad history) to create a comprehensive ad set report. It filters for the most recent records in the history tables, joins these tables based on various ID fields and source relations, and then aggregates metrics like clicks, impressions, and spend at the ad set level. The result is a detailed report that includes account, campaign, and ad set information along with performance metrics.","[""Filtering"",""Integration"",""Aggregation""]"
model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__url_tags,"This SQL query processes Facebook ads creative history data, focusing on URL tags. It starts by selecting the most recent records, then filters for non-null URL tags. The query then parses the JSON-formatted URL tags, flattens the structure, and extracts key-value pairs along with their types from the URL tags.","[""Filtering"",""Cleaning"",""Featurization""]"
model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__account_report,"This SQL query combines data from two staging tables: basic ad report and account history. It joins these tables on account ID and source relation, filtering for the most recent account records. The query then aggregates ad performance metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) at the account and date level, while including various account details. The result is a comprehensive daily account-level report of Facebook ad performance with associated account information.","[""Filtering"",""Integration"",""Aggregation""]"
model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__campaign_report,"This SQL query combines data from multiple Facebook Ads-related tables to create a comprehensive campaign report. It joins account, campaign, and ad data with the basic ad report, filtering for the most recent records in history tables. The query then aggregates clicks, impressions, and spend data at the campaign level, providing a detailed view of campaign performance along with account and campaign details.","[""Filtering"",""Integration"",""Aggregation""]"
model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__url_report,"This SQL query integrates data from various Facebook Ads-related tables to create a comprehensive URL report. It joins information from ad accounts, campaigns, ad sets, ads, and creatives, focusing on URLs associated with the ads. The query filters out records where the URL is null, aggregates metrics like clicks, impressions, and spend, and groups the results by various dimensions including date, account, campaign, ad set, ad, and URL-related fields.","[""Integration"",""Filtering"",""Aggregation""]"
model.facebook_ads.facebook_ads__ad_report,"This SQL query integrates data from multiple Facebook Ads-related tables (ad reports, accounts, campaigns, ad sets, and ads) to create a comprehensive ad performance report. It joins these tables based on various IDs and the source relation, filters for the most recent records in history tables, and aggregates metrics such as clicks, impressions, and spend. The result is a detailed view of ad performance across different levels of the ad hierarchy (account, campaign, ad set, and ad).","[""Filtering"",""Integration"",""Aggregation""]"
model.facebook_ads.int_facebook_ads__creative_history,"This SQL query processes Facebook ad creative data, focusing on URL-related information. It starts by selecting the most recent records from the creative history, then joins this with URL tag data. The query extensively cleans and extracts various components of URLs (such as base URL, host, and path) and UTM parameters. It also handles cases where UTM parameters might be directly in the URL or in a separate tags table. The result is a comprehensive view of each creative's URL structure and associated tracking parameters.","[""Filtering"",""Cleaning"",""Featurization"",""Integration"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__basic_ad,"This SQL query performs data type casting and column renaming on a Facebook ads dataset. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary staging table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types. Finally, it casts some columns to different data types, renames a few columns, and applies a COALESCE function to handle potential NULL values in the 'clicks' column.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__account_history,"This SQL query stages data from a Facebook Ads account history source table. It casts fields to specific data types, renames some columns, and adds a flag to identify the most recent record for each account. The query also includes a mechanism to generate a surrogate key when the natural key (id) is missing.","[""Cleaning"",""Deduplication"",""Featurization""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__creative_history,"This SQL query performs several data transformations on the Facebook Ads creative history data. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary table, then casts various fields to specific data types. The query renames some columns, such as changing 'id' to 'creative_id'. It also adds a 'source_relation' column and creates an 'is_most_recent_record' flag using window functions to identify the most recent record for each creative ID. Finally, it selects all columns from the transformed data.","[""Cleaning"",""Deduplication"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__campaign_history,"This SQL query stages data from a temporary Facebook Ads campaign history table. It casts columns to specific data types, renames some columns, and adds a flag to identify the most recent record for each campaign. The query also includes a source relation column, though it's set to an empty string in this example.","[""Cleaning"",""Deduplication"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__ad_history,"This SQL query performs several operations on the Facebook Ads data. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary staging table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types. The final select statement casts various ID fields to BIGINT, renames some columns, and adds an 'is_most_recent_record' flag. This flag is determined using a ROW_NUMBER() function, which helps in identifying the most recent record for each unique ad (or source relation if id is null).","[""Cleaning"",""Deduplication"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__ad_set_history,"This SQL query performs several transformations on data from a Facebook Ads source table. It casts various fields to specific data types, renames some columns, and adds a flag to identify the most recent record for each ad set. The query also includes logic to handle cases where 'id' and 'updated_time' might be null.","[""Cleaning"",""Deduplication"",""Other""]"
model.facebook_ads_source.stg_facebook_ads__creative_history_tmp,"This SQL query creates an empty result set with a single column named '_dbt_source_relation' of type TEXT, initialized to NULL.
