model.amplitude.amplitude__event_enhanced,"This SQL query combines and enhances event data from Amplitude. It deduplicates raw event data, joins it with event type and session data, and adds additional columns such as session and user event numbers. The query also incorporates various event and session-related metrics, and finally generates a unique key for each event.","[""Deduplication"",""Integration"",""Featurization"",""Cleaning""]"
model.amplitude.amplitude__daily_performance,"This SQL query creates a daily performance report for Amplitude events. It starts by joining event data with a date spine to ensure all dates are represented. It then aggregates event data to calculate daily counts of events, sessions, users, and new users for each event type. Finally, it combines this information, fills in any missing values with zeros, and generates a unique key for each daily record.","[""Integration"",""Aggregation"",""Featurization"",""Cleaning""]"
model.amplitude.amplitude__sessions,"This SQL query processes event data from Amplitude to create a comprehensive session analysis. It deduplicates raw event data, aggregates events into sessions, calculates session metrics (such as duration and events per session), ranks sessions by user, and determines time between sessions. The query also identifies first sessions for each user and calculates the time gap between consecutive sessions.","[""Deduplication"",""Aggregation"",""Featurization"",""Cleaning""]"
model.amplitude.amplitude__user_enhanced,"This query combines data from two tables (amplitude__event_enhanced and amplitude__sessions) to create a user-centric view. It calculates various user metrics including their creation time, first and last session times, total events and sessions, average session length, and average time between sessions. The results are grouped by the user ID, providing a comprehensive overview of user activity and engagement.","[""Integration"",""Aggregation"",""Featurization""]"
model.amplitude.int_amplitude__date_spine,"This SQL query creates a date spine (a continuous series of dates) for each event type in the amplitude__event_enhanced table. It generates dates from 2020-01-01 to 2024-08-01, then joins this with the event data to create a record for each event type on every day since its first occurrence. The query also generates a unique key for each date-event type combination.","[""Integration"",""Featurization"",""Other""]"
model.amplitude_source.stg_amplitude__event_type,"This SQL query performs a series of transformations on data from a staging table for Amplitude event types. It casts columns to specific data types, renames and reorganizes fields, and creates a unique identifier for each event type using a hash function. The query doesn't filter or aggregate data, but rather focuses on restructuring and cleaning the existing information.","[""Cleaning"",""Featurization"",""Other""]"
model.amplitude_source.stg_amplitude__event,"This SQL query processes data from an Amplitude event source. It performs several transformations including casting data types, creating derived columns (like event_day and unique_session_id), and applying filters based on event time. The query also generates a unique event ID using an MD5 hash of multiple fields. It selects a wide range of columns, some directly from the source and others with modifications or as newly calculated fields.","[""Filtering"",""Cleaning"",""Featurization"",""Other""]"
model.amplitude_source.stg_amplitude__event_type_tmp,"This SQL query selects all columns and rows from the 'event_type' table in the 'amplitude' schema of the 'TEST' database. It's a simple SELECT * statement without any filtering, transformation, or aggregation.","[""Other""]"
