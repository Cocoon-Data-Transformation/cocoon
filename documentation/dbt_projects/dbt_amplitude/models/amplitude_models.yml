          client_upload_time) 2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000 We use this timestamp to
          organize events on Amplitude charts. Note: If the difference between
          server_received_time and client_upload_time is less than 60 seconds, the
          event_time will not be adjusted and will equal the client_event_time

          All events within the same session share the same session ID. By default, the setting in Amplitude for the session property is session ID. All events with the same session ID and the same user ID will be grouped into the same session. The session ID does not have to be unique across multiple users. Session IDs for events sent via the Amplitude SDKs are automatically generated and managed. However, for events sent via the HTTP API, Amplitude defaults to a session ID of -1. This means the event is excluded from all session metrics.

          A readable ID specified by you.
          Amplitude uses a combination of three different methods to identify your users: device IDs, Amplitude ID, and user IDs. The first comes directly from your users' devices, while the second is an ID that Amplitude automatically creates once it has enough information to conclusively identify a unique user. The user ID, however, is something you'd set up.
          In Amplitude, a user ID is a unique identifier applied to individual users. Using them is optional, but recommended: your product should set a user ID once a user has created an account, logged in, or is otherwise identified in your product.
          Amplitude can use a user ID to reconcile events across multiple devices under the same user ID. Additionally, a user's event data will be merged on the backend so that all anonymous events prior to the assignment of a user ID will be connected to the correct user. For this reason, you can wait to assign user IDs if that makes sense for your product. Conversely, this is also why you should not set user IDs for anonymous users.
          Once set, user IDs in Amplitude cannot be changed.Once set, user IDs in Amplitude cannot be changed.
