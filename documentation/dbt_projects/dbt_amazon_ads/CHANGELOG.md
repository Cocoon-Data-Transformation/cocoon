# dbt_amazon_ads v0.3.0
[PR #11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/pull/11) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple amazon_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.
