model.sap_source.stg_sap__t001,"This SQL query performs data type casting and column selection on the 'stg_sap__t001_tmp' table. It starts by selecting all columns from the base table, then casts a large number of columns to specific data types (mostly TEXT) in the 'fields' CTE. Finally, it selects and casts a subset of columns from the 'fields' CTE to create the final output.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__mara,"This SQL query performs a data type conversion and column selection operation on a staging table for SAP material data (MARA). It casts all columns to specific data types (mostly TEXT, with some DECIMAL and TIMESTAMP) and then selects a subset of these columns for the final output. The query doesn't filter, transform, or aggregate the data beyond these type conversions and column selections.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__t880,"This SQL query stages data from a temporary table 'TEST.PUBLIC_stg_sap.stg_sap__t880_tmp' into a more structured format. It defines the data types for various fields, although most are cast as NULL in this intermediate step. The final output selects only three columns (mandt, rcomp, and name1) from the structured data, with mandt being explicitly cast as TEXT.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__faglflexa,"This SQL query is primarily focused on cleaning and transforming data from a staging table (TEST.PUBLIC_stg_sap.stg_sap__faglflexa_tmp). It defines specific data types for each column, casts certain columns to ensure proper data types, and selects a subset of columns for the final output. The query doesn't perform any filtering, deduplication, featurization, integration, or aggregation.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__lfa1,"This SQL query performs a simple data extraction and column selection from a staging table 'stg_sap__lfa1_tmp'. It first creates a CTE named 'base' to select all columns from the source table. Then, it defines another CTE named 'fields' where it explicitly casts all columns to specific data types, although all casts are to NULL. Finally, it selects a subset of columns from the 'fields' CTE in the 'final' CTE, which is then used in the main SELECT statement. The query essentially extracts specific columns from the source table while ensuring consistent data types.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__pa0031,"This SQL query performs a basic data transformation and type casting operation on the 'stg_sap__pa0031_tmp' table. It creates a CTE named 'fields' where it explicitly casts all columns to specific data types, mostly as TEXT, with a few exceptions for _fivetran_deleted (BOOLEAN), _fivetran_rowid (DECIMAL), and _fivetran_synced (TIMESTAMP). The query then selects a subset of these fields in a specific order in the 'final' CTE, excluding the _fivetran_ columns. The main purpose seems to be to standardize the data types and structure of the output.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__bkpf,"This SQL query performs a data type conversion and column selection operation on a staging table for SAP BKPF (Accounting Document Header) data. It casts various fields to specific data types (mostly TEXT, with some DECIMAL and TIMESTAMP) and selects a subset of columns from the original table. The query doesn't perform any filtering, aggregation, or complex transformations.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__bseg,"This SQL query appears to be a data transformation and type casting operation. It starts with a base table, creates a fields CTE where it casts numerous columns to specific data types (mostly TEXT and DECIMAL), and then selects a subset of these fields in the final CTE. The query doesn't perform any filtering, aggregation, or complex transformations, but rather focuses on standardizing the data types of the columns and selecting specific fields from the original dataset.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__pa0000,"This SQL query performs a simple data transformation on the 'stg_sap__pa0000_tmp' table. It starts by selecting all columns from the base table, then explicitly casts each column to a specific data type in the 'fields' CTE.

model.sap_source.stg_sap__pa0007,"This SQL query performs a data type casting operation on a temporary staging table for SAP PA0007 data. It creates a CTE named 'fields' where all columns are cast to specific data types (BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, TEXT). The query then selects all columns from this CTE in a specific order, effectively standardizing the data types and structure of the output.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__pa0008,"This SQL query performs a data type casting operation on a staging table. It selects all columns from a temporary table, casts them to specific data types (such as BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, and TEXT), and then selects a subset of these cast columns in a specific order for the final output. The query doesn't filter, transform, or aggregate the data beyond these casting operations.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__ska1,"This SQL query performs a basic data transformation for the 'stg_sap__ska1' model. It selects all columns from a temporary table, casts them to specific data types (mostly to TEXT, with a few exceptions), and then reorganizes the columns in a specific order in the final SELECT statement. The query doesn't perform any filtering, cleaning, deduplication, featurization, integration, or aggregation.","[""Cleaning""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__faglflext,"This SQL query is primarily focused on data type casting and column selection. It starts by selecting all columns from a temporary table, then defines a set of fields with specific data types (mostly converting to TEXT or DECIMAL).

The query doesn't perform any filtering, aggregation, or complex transformations.","[""Cleaning"",""Other""]"
model.sap_source.stg_sap__t503,"This SQL query performs a basic extraction and type casting operation on the 'stg_sap__t503_tmp' table.
