# dbt_linkedin v0.8.0
[PR #32](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/32) includes the following updates:

## Breaking changes
- Updated materializations of [dbt_linkedin_source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) non-`tmp` staging models from views to tables. This is to bring the materializations into alignment with other ad reporting packages and eliminate errors in Redshift.
- Updated the name of the source created by `dbt_linkedin_source` from `linkedin` to `linkedin_ads`. This was to bring the naming used in this package in alignment with our other ad packages and for compatibility with the union schema feature.
  - ‚ùó If you are using this source, you will need to update the name.
- Updated the following identifiers for consistency with the source name and compatibility with the union schema feature:

| current  | previous |
|----------|----------|
| linkedin_ads_account_history_identifier | linkedin_account_history_identifier
| linkedin_ads_ad_analytics_by_creative_identifier | linkedin_ad_analytics_by_creative_identifier
| linkedin_ads_campaign_group_history_identifier | linkedin_campaign_group_history_identifier
| linkedin_ads_campaign_history_identifier | linkedin_campaign_history_identifier
| linkedin_ads_creative_history_identifier | linkedin_creative_history_identifier
| linkedin_ads_ad_analytics_by_campaign_identifier | linkedin_ad_analytics_by_campaign_identifier

- If you are using the previous identifier, be sure to update to the current version!

## Feature update üéâ
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple linkedin connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood üöò
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.

[PR #29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/329) includes the following updates:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).

# dbt_linkedin v0.7.0
## üö® Breaking Changes üö®
Due to Linkedin Ads API [change in January 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/recent-changes?view=li-lms-2022-12#january-2023), there have been updates in the Linkedin Ads Fivetran Connector and therefore, updates to this Linkedin package. 

The following fields have been completely deprecated in the `stg_linkedin_ads__creative_history` model ([dbt_linkedin_source PR #48](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_source/pull/48)) and therefore removed from the below respective models in this package([#28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/28)):
- `type` (removed from `*_creative_report`)
- `call_to_action_label_type` (removed from `*_creative_report`)
- `version_tag` (removed from `*_creative_report` and `*_url_report`)

## Updates
[PR #28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/28) introduces the below changes:
- `linkedin_ads__creative_report` now leverages `report.creative_id` instead of `creative.creative_id`. 
- `linkedin_ads__campaign_report` now leverages `report.campaign_id` instead of `campaign.campaign_id`.
- `linkedin_ads__url_report` now leverages `report.creative_id` instead of `creative.creative_id`.

## Under the hood
- `integration_tests/seed/linkedin_creative_history_data` has been updated to reflect new fields and deprecated field updates
- Legacy fields have been updated respectively in the connector and `dbt_linkedin_source v0.7.0` includes modifications that could affect the below fields within the `linkedin_ads__creative_history` model:
  - `last_modified_at`
  - `created_at`
  - `status`
  
For more information, please refer to [dbt_linkedin_source PR #48](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_source/pull/48).
# dbt_linkedin v0.6.1

## Bugfixes
- `linkedin_ads__url_report` will now effectively filter out all those entries from `stg_linkedin_ads__creative_history` that are not the latest version of the creative. ([PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/26))

- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `packages.yml` has been updated to reflect new default `fivetran/fivetran_utils` version, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

## üéâ Features üéâ
- For use in the [dbt_ad_reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting), users can now allow records having nulls in url fields to be included in the `ad_reporting__url_report` model. See the [dbt_ad_reporting README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting) for more details ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/24)). 
## üöò Under the Hood üöò
- Disabled the `not_null` test for `linkedin_ads__url_report` when null urls are allowed ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/24)).

# dbt_linkedin v0.5.0

PR [#21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/pull/21) includes the following changes:

## üö® Breaking Changes üö®
- **ALL** models and **ALL** variables now have the prefix `linkedin_ads_*`. They previously were prepended with `linkedin_*`. This includes the required schema and database variables. We made this change to better discern between Linkedin Ads and [Linkedin Pages](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_pages/tree/main).
- The following models have been renamed:
  - `linkedin__account_ad_report` -> `linkedin_ads__account_report`
  - `linkedin__campaign_ad_report` -> `linkedin_ads__campaign_report`
  - `linkedin__campaign_group_ad_report` -> `linkedin_ads__campaign_group_report`
- The `linkedin__ad_adapter` model has been renamed and refactored into two separate models:
  - `linkedin_ads__url_report`: Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the url level.
  - `linkedin_ads__creative_report`: Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the creative level.
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed. To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough columns in the following format:
```yml
vars:
  linkedin_ads__campaign_passthrough_metrics: # this will pass through fields to the account, campaign, and campaign group report models. it pulls from `ad_analytics_by_campaign`
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
  linkedin_ads__creative_passthrough_metrics: # this will pass through fields to the creative and url report models.  it pulls from `ad_analytics_by_creative`
    - name: "my_field_to_include"
      alias: "field_alias"
```
- Staging models are now by default written within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_linkedin_ads_source`) in your destination. Previously, this was titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_linkedin`).

## üéâ Feature Enhancements üéâ
- README updates for easier navigation and use of the package.
- Addition of identifier variables for each of the source tables to allow for further flexibility in source table direction within the dbt project.
- Addition of new columns to `_report` models.
- More complete table and column documentation.
- More robust schema tests.

# dbt_linkedin v0.4.0
üéâ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility üéâ
## üö® Breaking Changes üö®
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_linkedin_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_linkedin_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_linkedin v0.1.0 -> v0.3.0
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
