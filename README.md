How to start?

We provide demo codes at google collab.

To use cocoon, you need:
1. OpenAI account with API key
2. Your data
3. Internet

Which models do cocoon use?

We use the best model in the market.
Currently, GPT-4-turbo has both high performance and cheap.

We also use embedding. ada-002 for now.

How to get OpenAI API key for GPT-4?
You need to register an account (with an email)
You need to bind a phone. This allows you to generate API key.
OpenAI gives you $5 free credit. But you need to add a billing and purchase $1 credit for GPT-4 access.

How much costs?
10 ~ 50 cents for most data

Data Privacy.

OpenAI API is not HIPPA complaint. It is recommended to take a sample and first privatize to see the effect.

1) OPENAI Enterprise
2) Apply for Azure Openai service (easier)
