We also use embedding. ada-002 for now.

How to get OpenAI API key for GPT-4?
You need to register an account (with an email)
You need to bind a phone. This allows you to generate API key.
OpenAI gives you $5 free credit. But you need to add a billing and purchase $1 credit for GPT-4 access.

How much costs?
10 ~ 50 cents for most data

Data Privacy.

OpenAI API is not HIPPA complaint. It is recommended to take a sample and first privatize to see the effect.

For HIPPA complaiance
1) OPENAI Enterprise
2) Apply for Azure Openai service (easier)

Report Error
Please provide some sample data (a few rows would be sufficient) to reproduce the error.
