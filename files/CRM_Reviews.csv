2017-08-21,5,"We had a past experience with Eagle National Mortgage and would without question use again and again if needed!! Eagle went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money. We would highly recommend Brad Thomka and the Eagle National Mortgage team for your mortgage needs. Sincerest thanks Eagle!! Ed & Lind",Eagle National Mortgage,23
2017-12-17,5,"We have been dealing with Brad Thomka from the beginning of what started out to be a very stressful time for us, but with the help from Brad and the entire Eagle Mortgage team it was turned into a happy ending!! Brad and Eagle went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money.

2016-05-27,5,"I can't express how grateful I am for the support that Zach provided to me and my family during this home purchase! His customer service, responsiveness and professional demeanor is second to none. He was very thorough and took the time to educate me about the process along the way. I highly recommend working with Zach and Eagle National!",Eagle National Mortgage,24
2016-12-20,5,"I had the pleasure of working with Eagle National in September 2018 as my family and I were making a home purchase in Columbus, OH. From the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from Eagle was very responsive and professional. I was VERY impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be",Eagle National Mortgage,15
2017-12-17,5,"My experience with Mattison was beyond greatly professionally done!! She really cares about her clients needs! She stays on top of everything and if there was a misunderstanding, she would be on top of it for you. Overall she truly bends her back professionally for her clients. She is a wonderful person!",Eagle National Mortgage,12
2016-08-16,5,Patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure I got the right loan for my situation. The portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. Very pleased with the customer service and intend on using Patrick again when we refinance later!!!!,Eagle National Mortgage,55
2017-04-09,5,"I loved working with this group of people! They laughed with me over the phone! Always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! Knowledgeable staff! While we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed Eagle, they lost my business because of it. When I told Eagle about it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the ""sell""",Eagle National Mortgage,25
2016-03-22,5,Great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. Quick responses to any questions or concerns. Willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren't always an option for us.,Eagle National Mortgage,18
2017-02-04,5,"Working with Michelle and Eagle went really well for me. As a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, I feel that this process was smooth and successful. I will definitely recommend Michelle to friends and family.",Eagle National Mortgage,37
2016-06-02,5,"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",Eagle National Mortgage,8
2016-11-06,5,Jay was easy to get a hold of if I had any questions so that was huge to me because there's a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything's right. He provided as great a service as I could've wanted,Eagle National Mortgage,32
2017-04-03,5,If I had a million Friends I would recommend all of them to Eagle National especially to Mark Taylor he’s great he really help with even of the clock thanks a million mark I mean that from heart I appreciate everything you did for me.,Eagle National Mortgage,60
2016-06-11,5,"Chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. Again, cannot say enough positive things about Chaz. Consummate professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities",Eagle National Mortgage,38
2016-03-07,5,Austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. He explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the B.S other companies use to get your business . Being a repeat customer says it all.,Eagle National Mortgage,1
2016-07-10,5,The salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him I'm looking for a heloc specifically. Then he hangs up on me because I said I was quoted a better rate at TD bank. Ridiculous....,Eagle National Mortgage,55
2017-02-24,1,"This was the worst experience ever. It was like they had never gone through the process before. I could not get a complete list of the documents required. Every other day it was a new request. The appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes I had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. Wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. There were many documents that I had to send 3 and 4 times because they ""lost"" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. I would NEVER use them. Awful experience!",Eagle National Mortgage,20
2016-03-14,1,"A good rate but a very frustrating process, constant delays, decisions made then changed, overwhelmed underwriting team with 3 week back log, rookie mistake related to Texas law that caused an additional 2 week wait. Closing happened almost 6 weeks after it should have. Courteous and professional, but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency. Would not recommend",Eagle National Mortgage,65
2017-08-13,1,"They were not upfront. Learn from my mistake... I trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the Good Faith Estimate with higher rate plus lender's credit. After running my numbers, the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now, I'm being charge points. It looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lender",Eagle National Mortgage,66
2016-06-26,1,"Initially, the Mortgage Broker was very friendly and assertive. Once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent, it became increasingly difficult to reach the broker. I had to initiate all phone calls. It seemed as if I had to call to make the process move forward. It took four weeks to get a copy of my closing documents and the payoff for my credit card",Eagle National Mortgage,63

2016-01-15,5,"I worked with Kory and Carla at NASB. They were a superb team and provided excellent, responsive and knowledgeable service throughout the entire process. Ours was a complicated process with a refinance and a loan and they hung in there with us the entire time. It was a great experience working with both of them. I highly recommend them and will use them in the future for all of my mortgage needs",Eagle National Bank,34
2017-11-10,5,"Kory was by far the best loan officer I have ever worked with. We were dealing with a complicated refinance and purchase of two different properties and he was cool, calm, professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I wouldn’t use anyone else moving forward. His level of integrity and responsiveness is second to none. Thanks for everything, Kory",Eagle National Bank,28
2016-10-14,5,"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him. ",Eagle National Bank,48
2016-08-01,5,"The NASB team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important VA home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging Antebellum home that required the entire NASB team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough VA process. I truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. I will only recommend NASB for home loans...especially complicate VA loans",Eagle National Bank,40
2016-10-22,5,"Dallas Goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. He was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. We were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. It was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like Dallas. Great job!",Eagle National Bank,14
2017-12-09,5,"Comments: To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat NASB but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose NASB because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. Dallas Goodlet/ Brent Custer and the whole NASB team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. We are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. Kudos to all ",Eagle National Bank,63
2017-05-24,5,"Working with Jon was such an amazing experience! From the start he offered answers to any questions I had since after all this was our first home purchase! Jon was always a phone call away ready to help where needed. He made the stringent home buying process as easy as possible! I would definitely recommend any potential buyers to work with Jon, I know for myself I will be calling him if we ever decide to buy another house! Thanks Jon",Eagle National Bank,54
2017-02-05,5,NASB was amazing to work with! The pre-approval process was easy and informational. We chose our home and closed within 30 days of our agreement date! Thanks NASB for making our first home purchase an amazing experience!,Eagle National Bank,34
2016-07-18,5,"Jon Barrett was a great asset to my husband and I. He made our mortgage loan process extremely simple and quick! Jon was knowledgeable, helpful, patient and accurate. We will be passing Jon's name along to anyone looking for a mortgage loan!",Eagle National Bank,5

From the very first conversation that I had with Steve, I knew that he understood our situation perfectly and he was able to help us achieve our dream of home ownership. We were given very realistic expectations from the beginning and Steve kept in touch with us throughout the process. It was a relief to work with someone who gave us accurate information and didn't string us along.... Read More

2017-10-02,5,"I can't express how incredibly awesome our experience was with working with Bryant Small at NASB. As a military family, we have purchased or refinanced many homes and this was by far the BEST experience we have ever had. Bryant makes it easy and took the time to discuss the best options for us. I've never met Bryant, but you can't mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and NASB were who we were going with. ",Eagle National Bank,33
